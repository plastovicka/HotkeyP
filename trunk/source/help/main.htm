<Title>HotkeyP help</Title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
The button "Add" creates a new hotkey at the end of list. The button "Insert" creates a new hotkey before the current item. Hotkeys can be also created by dragging & dropping icons from the desktop, or files from the explorer. Existing hotkey can be edited by double clicking on the item in the listbox. You can sort the list by clicking on the column header. If you sort it by the first column, then you can use a mouse to change order of items.
<p>
When you run HotkeyP for the first time, you must save your hotkeys to the file. Next time all changes will be saved automatically at the moment when you close the hotkeys window. Every user who logs in the Windows can create his own HTK file.
<p>
<A NAME=-1>
Hotkey can be any key combined with Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Win. Most keyboards have Win key placed between Ctrl and Alt. It is possible, but not recommended to define hotkeys like CapsLock, F1, Shift+A, Ctrl+C, Alt+F4. All multimedia keys can be used, but some other programs can block them and those programs must be closed or uninstalled. Some unknown keys are displayed as a number in parenthesis, but you can rename them in the options.   
<p>
Each hotkey can be assigned to an executable file, document, www page or to some internal command. You can write file name directly into the "<u>Command:</u>" edit box or you can use "..." button to open the file dialog or you can drag and drop files from Explorer. You can use environment variables in the file path, for example %SystemRoot%. Variable %HotkeyP% is replaced by the installation folder where is HotkeyP.exe. If you don't specify path before the file name then directories from system variable PATH are searched. 
<p>
You can also write a web page or email address directly to the command edit box. It must begin with www. or http:// or https:// or mailto:.
<p>
Internal command can be easily chosen from popup menu after mouse click on "&lt;" button.
<p>
If you want to hear sound whenever you press a hotkey, you can enter WAV file to the "<u>Sound</u>:" field.
<p>
If you check "<u>Enable multiple instances</u>", each hotkey starts a new application. If you don't check this option and the application is already running, then the application is activated. If it is already active, then it is minimized. Option "Enable multiple instances" works only for executable files. If you open a document, it depends on the application whether it opens the document in a new window or in an already existing window.
<p>
If you check the "<u>Add to the notification icon menu</u>", this hotkey will be added the popup menu which is shown when you right-click the system tray icon. Write menu item string to the description field. If the description contains two characters <tt>-></tt>, a submenu will be created. Submenus can be nested (for example submenu1<tt>-></tt>submenu2<tt>-></tt>item).      
<p>
The checkbox "<u>Run automatically after Windows starts</u>" (in the Hot Key dialog box) works only if the HotkeyP is run automatically after the Windows starts, or if you start the HotkeyP manually with parameter 0.
<p>
You should check "<u>Run as administrator</u>" only if the application needs admin privileges. This option is useful if the User account control (UAC) is enabled in the Windows control panel (it is enabled by default). If the HotkeyP is not running as admin, annoying "User Account Control" dialog will be shown when the hotkey is pressed. If the HotkeyP is <a href="#admin">running as admin</a>, it will be able to launch applications as administrator directly without consent.
<p>
Write description of the command to the "<u>Description:</u>" field. If you leave this note empty, the filename without path is used. The description is visible in the listbox in the main window.
<p>
Opacity is an integer from 0 to 255 which means from transparent to opaque. If the value is zero, the opacity will not be set and a program will start faster.

<h2>Mouse shortcuts</h2>
Mouse shortcuts are created similarly to keyboard shortcuts. Move mouse cursor on the white edit box that is at the top of the "Hot Key" window. Then press one or more mouse buttons or rotate the mouse wheel. The word Mouse will appear in the edit box and the sum of L, R, M, 4, 5, Up, Down, Left, Right. That means left button, right button, middle button, X1 button, X2 button, wheel up, wheel down, wheel left, wheel right. Mouse buttons can be combined with keys Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Win.
<p>
If your mouse has 5 buttons, but you cannot use the fourth and fifth buttons in HotkeyP, you may have installed a wrong driver or there is some application which blocks these buttons (e.g. Genius Netscroll+ Optical Mouse). You will have to close that application and remove it from the startup group. You must not uninstall Genius software because it would uninstall the driver too. But you can delete or rename gnetmous.exe file if you want to use HotkeyP instead of it.             
<p>
A horizontal wheel does not work on Windows XP or older.
<p>
There is option "Delay mouse buttons" in the options dialog box. It is used for shortcuts which consist of two or more buttons. HotkeyP will delay only those buttons for which some shortcut exists. For example, if you create shortcut R+L, the right button will be delayed, if you create shortcut M+R, the middle button will be delayed. If the interval between mouse buttons is longer than the "Delay mouse buttons" value, the shortcut will be executed too, but a message about buttons press will be sent to a window under the mouse cursor. For example, if you have a shortcut R+L and you wait too long between buttons R and L, the shortcut will be executed and after you release the right button, a context menu will be shown. If you want to drag&drop files with the right button, press the right button, then you must wait until the file is selected and after that you can start moving the mouse. This behavior is disabled for the left button, because drag&drop with the left button is used very often. The buttons delay is not convenient for games, so there is option to disable it for some applications. Write exe file names without paths to the edit box, separate them by semicolons.     
<p>
<h2>Remote control</h2>
Hotkeys can be defined for a remote control buttons, too. You have to install the WinLIRC (<A href="http://winlirc.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://winlirc.sourceforge.net</A>). After you install and configure WinLIRC, go to HotkeyP options, set path to winlirc.exe and check Enable.  

<h2>Categories</h2>
It is convenient to classify your hotkeys, especially if you have many hotkeys. There is a category panel at the left side of the HotkeyP window. Some categories are created automatically and cannot be modified (these categories are: keyboard, mouse, joystick, remote, commands, programs, documents, web links, autorun, tray menu). Besides them you can create your own categories. Select hotkeys which will be in a new category, then choose command "Assign to selected hotkeys" from the menu Category, write name of the new category and click OK. The command "Assign to selected hotkeys" is used not only for creating new categories, but also to move hotkeys from one category to another, just choose some existing category from the dropdown list. If you leave the category name empty, selected hotkeys will be moved to the category "default". If you delete a category, all hotkeys from that category will be moved to default category.

<h2>Hook</h2>
Hook is a procedure that is called whenever a key is pressed. You can disable the hook in the options, but then some multimedia keys (which are displayed as number in brackets) will not work and you will not be able to set hotkeys for CapsLock and Win+M, Win+E, Win+R etc. The hook is also required for "Macro" and "Paste text" commands to work properly. 
If you check option "Use keyboard hook for all hotkeys", the hotkeys will work in games and other DirectX applications too. 
<p>
The hook doesn't work in applications which are running as administrator unless the HotkeyP is <a href="#admin">running as administrator</a> too.

<h2>Internal commands</h2>

Most commands have some parameters which are usually optional. Parameters are separated by a space. 
<p>
Internal commands can be executed not only by hotkeys, but also from the command line. For example, the computer can be restarted by command hotkeyp -reboot. It is useful in scripts or BAT files. They can be used in schedulers or you can put them to the startup group.
If you use more than one command after hotkeyp on the command line, separate them by semicolons.

<A NAME=13><A NAME=14><A NAME=15><A NAME=16><A NAME=78>
<h3>Volume, Volume +, Volume -</h3>
This command sets or increases or decreases audio volume. The first parameter is percent (an integer from 0 to 100). The second parameter is an audio line name (Mixer, Wave, MIDI, CD Audio, Line In, Microphone, Bass, Treble, ...). Actual names depend on your sound card and you can see them in the Volume Control application in Windows accessories. The Mixer is synonym for the default output volume. If you want to change recording volume, add prefix R: to the audio line name (for example R:Microphone).
<p>If you have more than one sound card, write number and colon before audio line name on Windows&nbsp;98/ME/2000/XP (for example 2:Mixer), or append one space and sound card name in parenthesis on Windows Vista/7/8/10 (for example Speakers (Creative SB X-Fi)).
<p>The "Show these audio lines:" edit box in the options dialog box contains comma-separated audio line names that are displayed every time this hotkey is pressed. There can be a display name and equals sign before an audio line name (for example Volume=Mixer,Record=R:Microphone ).<br>

<A NAME=17><A NAME=58>
<h3>Mute</h3>
Disables or enables an audio line. The parameter is an audio line name (Mixer, Wave, MIDI, CD Audio, Line In, Microphone, ...).<br>

<A NAME=0><A NAME=1><A NAME=62>
<h3>Eject/Close CD</h3>
Ejects or closes door of the CD or DVD drive. Optional parameter is the drive letter.<br>
NOTE:  If this command only ejects CD, but cannot close it, then you have to create two different hotkeys for commands Eject CD and Close CD. These commands are not in the drop-down menu, so you must write them manually into the Command edit box.

<A NAME=39><A NAME=40><A NAME=41><A NAME=42>
<h3>Play CD, Stop, Next track, Previous track</h3>
Plays audio CD. Other programs for playing CD must not be running.
Optional parameter is the drive letter.

<A NAME=100>
<h3>CD speed</h3>
The first parameter is speed (10, 16, 24, 32, 40 etc.). The second parameter is drive letter.

<A NAME=67>
<h3>Paste text</h3>
Parameter is a text that is pasted to an active window through the clipboard by Ctrl+V. You can specify multiple texts separated by %|. In that case, pressing the hotkey will display a listbox and then you will choose an item by double-click or by pressing key down and Enter. For example, parameter ab%|cdef%|ghi leads to a popup window which has 3 rows: ab, cdef, ghi. The popup window can be canceled by the Esc key.<br>
The text can contain some special sequences: %r - end of line, %u - user name, %o - computer name, %l - clipboard content, %% - percent sign, %x - date, %X - time, %c - date and time, %d - day, %m - month, %Y - year, %y - year without century, %H - hour [0-23], %I - hour [1-12], %p - AM/PM, %M - minute, %S - second, %A - weekday name, %a - abbreviated weekday name, %B - month name, %b - abbreviated month name, %#d - day without leading zeros, similarly %#m, %#H, %#I, %#M, %#S

<A NAME=27>
<h3>Macro</h3>
Parameter is a text string which can contain sequences \esc, \tab, \backspace, \enter, \space, \left, \right, \up, \down, \ins, \del, \home, \end, \pageup, \pagedown, \f1, \f2, ..., \shift, \rshift, \ctrl, \rctrl, \alt, \ralt, \win, \rwin, \apps, \capslock, \scrolllock, \numlock, \pause, \printscreen, \divide, \multiply, \add, \subtract, \decimal, \0, \1, ..., \num0, \num1, ..., \A, \B, ..., \back, \forward, \refresh, \search, \favorites, \browser, \mail, \power, \volume_down, \volume_up, \mute, \play_pause, \stop, \prev_track, \next_track, \media_select, \launch_app1, \launch_app2,  \lbutton, \rbutton, \mbutton, \xbutton1, \xbutton2, \wheelup, \wheeldown, \wheelleft, \wheelright, \doubleclick,  \sleep, \rep, \xAB.<br>
There can be a dot after every special sequence. If you only want to press down or to release a key, use suffix down or up. It is useful for combinations of two or more keys or buttons. For example \lbuttondown\rbutton\lbuttonup means mouse buttons L+R. Keys shift, ctrl, alt, win remain pressed together with the next character. For example \shift.a\shift.b is the same as \shiftdown.a\shiftup\shiftdown.b\shiftup and this is the same as AB. The ctrl key can be written as \^ .<br>
Macros \A \B \C etc. work with any keyboard layout (e.g. Russian or Greek) and can be used for shortcuts like \ctrl\C or \ctrl\V. If you use letters a b c or A B C, it will work only if the current language has Roman alphabet (Latin). It will also hold shift key for uppercase (or lowercase if the Caps Lock is active). Similarly, macros \1 \2 \3 etc. don't depend on the keyboard layout.<br>
There is a number after \sleep command which means delay in tenth of a second.<br>
There are two hexadecimal digits after \x sequence which mean a virtual key code.<br>
If you have set the option never use the keyboard hook, then a macro will NOT be repeated while you hold down a hotkey for a while. If you still want a macro to be repeated, prepend sequence \rep to the macro parameter. It has a drawback - shifts will remain pressed if you release them too quickly.   

<A NAME=94>
<h3>Macro to active window</h3>
The first parameter is like Macro parameter. The second parameter denotes a window. If this window is not in foreground, this command is not executed. The second parameter can contain characters &, |, ! which mean logical operators and, or, not. There must not be a space before or after these operators. Operator & has higher priority than |. You can use parenthesis to make more complex expressions. The window name must be written in apostrophes if it contains special characters & | ! ( ). If there is a space character in the window name, the entire second parameter must be written in quotation marks. For example "window 1"|"window 2" is error, it should be "window 1|window 2".<br>If you choose the option "Use hook for all hotkeys", a keydown event will be simulated when you press a "Macro to active window" hotkey and a keyup event will be simulated when you release this hotkey. If you disable the keyboard hook, then both keydown and keyup events will be simulated when you press this hotkey and nothing will happen when you release this hotkey.

<A NAME=26>
<h3>Send keys to window</h3>
Sends messages WM_KEYDOWN and then WM_KEYUP. The first parameter is a macro. The second parameter determines a window. This window is activated if the first parameter starts with \show. This command doesn't work for minimized windows. Some applications require three parameters: keys, EXE name, window class or title. If you specify only EXE name, it might not work for applications which have more than one window. If you specify only window class or window title and there are more applications that have that window, the keys are sent randomly to one application.     

<A NAME=74>
<h3>Keys to active window</h3>
This command is similar to "Send keys to window", but it is ignored when the window determined by the second parameter is not in foreground. It can be used to change keyboard or mouse accelerators of almost any application. The third optional parameter determines the window to which the keys are sent. This window needn't have keyboard focus, but must belong to the foreground application.   

<A NAME=21>
<h3>Send window command</h3>
Sends message WM_COMMAND to another window. The first parameter is a command number. Numbers can be found by spy.exe which can be started from the menu File. Unfortunately, it does not work for all applications (e.g. programs written in Java or .Net Framework or programs which have Unix user interface). The second and the third parameters determine a window, similarly to command "Send keys to window".

<h3>Command to active window</h3>
This command is similar to "Send window command", but it is ignored when the window determined by the second parameter is not in foreground. The command is sent to a window which is determined by the third optional parameter. Example for player Winamp: the second parameter must be winamp.exe, the third parameter must be "Winamp v1.x".    

<A NAME=61>
<h3>Multi command</h3>
It is used to assign a hotkey to execute more than one program or internal command. Parameters are numbers of previously created hotkeys. 

<A NAME=70>
<h3>Commands list</h3>
Parameters are similar to Multi command, but only the first parameter is executed when this hotkey is pressed. After that, the first number is moved to the end of parameters list. So you have to repeat pressing the hotkey to execute all items in the list.

<A NAME=37>
<h3>Move mouse cursor</h3>
Two parameters are relative coordinates of mouse movement. They must be separated by a space. If parameters are empty, mouse cursor is moved to the center of the screen.

<A NAME=75>

<h2>Run HotkeyP as administrator</h2>
You can skip this chapter if you have Windows XP or older or if you have disabled the User account control.<br>
If you use some applications which require administrator rights, you need run HotkeyP as administrator too. Otherwise some keyboard shortcuts and HotkeyP commands would not work (especially macro and paste text). If you want to start HotkeyP automatically at Windows startup, you have to create a task.
<ul>
<li>Find the Command prompt in the Start menu, click the right mouse button and select Run as administrator.
<li>Copy this command and paste it into the command prompt (replace Program Files by path where the HotkeyP is installed):<br>
<code>schtasks.exe /create /sc onlogon /tn HotkeyP /rl highest /tr "'C:\Program Files (x86)\HotkeyP\HotkeyP.exe' 0" /f</code>
<li>Start the Task scheduler.
<li>Select "Task scheduler library" in the left panel. Then double-click the HotkeyP task to show its properties.
<li>Click on the Settings tab and disable the option "Stop the task if it runs longer than 3 days". Then click OK and close the task scheduler window.
<li>Start HotkeyP and disable option "Start automatically at Windows startup".
</ul>
