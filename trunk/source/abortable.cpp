Cancel Command Dialog Box Callback
This code handles the "Cancel Command" dialog box that gives the user
a chance to cancel a command before it is executed.
It operates by alerting the user of the command that will be executed
and gives the user a chance to cancel/abort the command.
Only the option to cancel is given.  The rational is as follows.
If the dialog has an [OK] and [Cancel] buttons, the user can get in the
habit of invoking the command with a HotKey and typing the keys to
automatically select [OK].  The purpose if this dialog is to prevent
the user from typing something "from habit" that could invoke a command
s/he might later regret executing.  So this dialog forces the delay
the user might need to think about whether this was the correct command
to execute or not, and if it isn't the user has a few seconds to correct
the mistake.
